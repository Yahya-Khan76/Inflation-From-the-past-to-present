A comprehensive data science analysis examining inflation patterns across historical periods, from medieval economic crises (1260-1355) to modern central bank policy decisions. This project demonstrates advanced machine learning techniques applied to economic forecasting and policy analysis.

## üéØ Project Overview

This analysis combines **historical economic data** with **modern interest rate data** to understand inflation dynamics and predict monetary policy decisions using sophisticated machine learning approaches.

### Key Components

1. **Medieval Economic Analysis (1260-1355)**
   - War, disaster, and economic crisis correlation analysis
   - Consumer Price Index (CPI) trend analysis during turbulent periods
   - Advanced time series visualization with multi-variable scaling

2. **Modern Interest Rate Prediction (1997-2025)**
   - Bank of England rate change classification
   - Economic indicator integration and feature engineering
   - Advanced gradient boosting for monetary policy forecasting

3. **Sophisticated Machine Learning Pipeline** 
   - Linear regression with temporal dependencies
   - Logistic regression with class balancing for rate predictions
   - Gradient boosting classifier with hyperparameter optimization
   - Time series cross-validation and robust model evaluation

## üìä Key Findings & Results

### Historical Analysis
- Identified **crisis periods** where economic stress, warfare, and disasters reinforced each other
- Demonstrated correlation between **conflict intensity** and **economic disruption**
- Revealed monetary expansion patterns during periods of high military expenditure

### Modern Prediction Models
- **85% accuracy** in predicting Bank of England interest rate changes
- **Perfect recall** for rate increases (critical for financial planning)
- Identified **gilt yield averages** and **unemployment rates** as key policy drivers

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Machine Learning**: Linear/Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Cross-validation
